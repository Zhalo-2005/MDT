# Z-MDT System v2.0 - Deployment Instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Fixed

âœ… **Database Integration**: Fixed oxmysql connection issues and data loading  
âœ… **UI/Frontend**: Complete interface overhaul with all tabs functional  
âœ… **Job System**: Simplified to PD vs Ambulance detection (no grade complications)  
âœ… **Report Creation**: Fixed incident creation with proper validation  
âœ… **Jail System**: Added complete jail functionality with automatic time calculation  

## ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Backup Your Current Files
```bash
# Make backup of your current MDT
cp -r resources/[qb]/Z-MDT resources/[qb]/Z-MDT_backup
```

### Step 2: Replace Core Files
```bash
# Rename the improved files
cd resources/[qb]/Z-MDT/

# Server files
mv server/main_improved.lua server/main.lua
mv server/jail.lua server/jail.lua  # New file

# Client files  
mv client/main_improved.lua client/main.lua

# Shared files
mv shared/config_improved.lua shared/config.lua

# Web files
mv web/index_improved.html web/index.html
mv web/js/main_improved.js web/js/main.js

# Manifest
mv fxmanifest_improved.lua fxmanifest.lua
```

### Step 3: Database Update
```sql
-- No database changes needed - just ensure tables exist
-- Run the install.sql file if you haven't already
```

### Step 4: Configuration
Edit `shared/config.lua` with your server settings:

```lua
-- Simple job detection - just list your job names
Config.Jobs = {
    PoliceJobs = {'police', 'sheriff', 'state'}, -- Add your police jobs
    MedicalJobs = {'ambulance', 'ems'}           -- Add your medical jobs
}
```

### Step 5: Restart Resources
```bash
# In your server console:
restart Z-MDT
# or
ensure Z-MDT
```

    BaseTimePerCharge = 300,        -- 5 minutes per charge
    GuiltyPleaReduction = 0.25,     -- 25% reduction for guilty plea
    MaxSentence = 3600,             -- 1 hour maximum
    Cells = {
        {id = 1, label = "Cell 1", coords = vector3(460.0, -994.0, 24.9)},

## ðŸŽ® Testing Checklist

After deployment, test these features:

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Open MDT with tablet item or F6 key
- [ ] Dashboard shows real player/vehicle counts
- [ ] Search for existing players by name/ID
- [ ] Search for vehicles by license plate
- [ ] Create incident reports
- [ ] Issue fines to players

### Jail System
- [ ] Add charges to calculate jail time
- [ ] Test guilty plea reduction (25% off)
- [ ] Verify jail cell assignment
- [ ] Check automatic release after time served

### Job Access
- [ ] Police officers see all police tabs
- [ ] Medical staff see medical tabs
- [ ] Job detection works without grade checks
- [ ] Admin access to all features

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "UI still shows old version"
```bash
# Clear browser cache
# Restart the resource completely
restart Z-MDT
```

### "Search not finding players"
```sql
-- Check if players exist in database
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM player_vehicles;
```

### "Jail system not working"
- Check jail configuration in `shared/config.lua`
- Ensure jail cells are properly configured
- Verify player is online when jailing

### "Job access not working"
- Check job names in config match your framework
- Use debug mode to see job detection:
```lua
Config.System.Debug = true
```

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

1. **Check Documentation**: Read `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` and `FIXES_SUMMARY.md`
2. **Enable Debug Mode**: Set `Config.System.Debug = true` for detailed logs
3. **Check Server Console**: Look for error messages
4. **Verify File Names**: Ensure all files are properly renamed

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

You'll know the deployment was successful when:

âœ… Dashboard shows real numbers (not 0, 0, 0, 0)  
âœ… Search finds existing players and vehicles  
âœ… Incident creation works without errors  
âœ… Jail time calculates automatically based on charges  
âœ… Job access works without grade complications  
âœ… All UI tabs are functional and complete  

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:
```bash
# Restore backup
rm -rf resources/[qb]/Z-MDT
mv resources/[qb]/Z-MDT_backup resources/[qb]/Z-MDT
restart Z-MDT
```
